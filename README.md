# Covid-19-Data-Visualisation-on-Indian-and-World-map
The world right now is facing a pandemic due to novel coronavirus disease (nCOVID) or coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Coronavirus is a family of viruses that can cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.This virus originated from Wuhan city of China and was first discovered in Nov,2019.

## Objective of the Project
In this project we will visualize and the spread of covid19 cases in India and in the world and will make comparisions between various cities and countries.

## Prerequisites
For implementing this project you should have a prior knowledge of the following libraries:
1. Pandas : library used here to deal with tabular data
2. Seaborn : For data visualization
3. Matlpotlib : For plotting the data
4. Reqest : Used to request to any url for html files(for web scraping)
5. Beautifulsoup : Used to extract html files from any site(url)
6. Geopandas : Used to deal with maps or geometric data

## Dataset
1. For plotting the maps of India and world, I have used shape files here. It is one of GIS ( geographic information system ) data collection.
2. The covid-19 data is extracted from the website of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India with help of BeautifulSoup.
