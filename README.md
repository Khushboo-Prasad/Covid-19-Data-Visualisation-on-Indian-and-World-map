For implementing this project you should have a prior knowledge of the following libraries:
1. Pandas : library used here to deal with tabular data
2. Seaborn : For data visualization
3. Matlpotlib : For plotting the data
4. Reqest : Used to request to any url for html files(for web scraping)
5. Beautifulsoup : Used to extract html files from any site(url)
6. Geopandas : Used to deal with maps or geometric data

## Dataset
1. For plotting the maps of India and world, I have used shape files here. It is one of GIS ( geographic information system ) data collection.
2. The covid-19 data is extracted from the website of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India with help of BeautifulSoup.
